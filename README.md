# RotatingSquares

A small project implementing the rotating squares that prof. Tadashi Tokieda is talking about in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAja2jp1VjE

An example of the project can be found here: http://sakarisson.com/javascript/rotatingsquares/

The purpose of this project was to learn some ES6 functionality - specifically the usage of classes in Javascript

This project needs work. Its code is very inefficient. It was written when waiting for a plane at the airport
